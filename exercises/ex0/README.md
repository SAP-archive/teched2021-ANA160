## Exercise 0.2 - SAP Data Intelligence

### Data Consumption
SAP Data Intelligence graph is a network of operators connected to each other using typed input ports and output ports for data transfer where users can define and configure the operators in a graph.

In our hands-on workshop we have used the custom Python Operator with custom eMobility API calls to consume and transform API data that are staged in SAP DWC for modeling.

The workshop is not focused on Data Pipelining and consumption, this is merely background information on data origin.

<br>

Data Intelligence Launchpad is a central access point for various tool sets with in the Data Intelligence Suite. The Modeler is the tool set used to create Graphs (Data Pipelines).
