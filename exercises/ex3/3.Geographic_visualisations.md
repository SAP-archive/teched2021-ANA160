# Exercise 3 - Geographic Visualizations

In this exercise we will build

- Geo map to present **Charging point Locations** 
- Bar chart to analyse **Charging Duration (hrs) by Charge Point Vendors**
- Chart to get insights on the **Total Consumption in kWH and Average charge Cost(€) by Vehicle Model**

You will find the definition of each of the above KPI in the respective section. For the rest of the pages, we have included the KPI definitions in the Appendix.

At the conclusion of this exercise your story will look similar to the image below

## Exercise 3.1 - Building a Geo Map

Select ``GeoMap`` on the story.

![](Images/3.Geographic_visualisations_images/image1.png)

<br>

Click on ``Edit`` (if not in Edit mode).

![](Images/3.Geographic_visualisations_images/image2.png)

<br>

Click on Insert Tool Bar and select ``Geo Map`` component.

![](Images/3.Geographic_visualisations_images/image3.png)

<br>

Drag Geo Map component to fit the selected area.

![](Images/3.Geographic_visualisations_images/image4.png)

<br>

Now click on the ``Geo Map`` area and then click ``Designer`` to see the ``Map properties``.

<br>

Click on ``Add Layer``.

![](Images/3.Geographic_visualisations_images/image6.png)

<br>

**Make sure you are pointing to the right Data Source (Emobility Teched)**


Select ``Location Dimension = Location``, Bubble ``Color= CONNECTORSTATUS`` and then click ``OK``.

Location is being sourced from the spatial reference built in SAP Data Warehouse Cloud.

<br>


**Tooltip information is seen on clicking the bubble**

![](Images/3.Geographic_visualisations_images/image7_3.png)

<br>

Now you see all the charging points on the ``GeoMap``.

<br>

## Exercise 3.2 - Adding Charging Duration (hrs) by Charge Point Vendor

<br>

Here we will look into ``total charging duration`` of the vehicles by different charge point vendors. This indicated if certain Charge Point Vendor technology is preferred.


Click on the tile as indicated below, then select ``Designer`` (if the designer is not selected) to open up the ``Builder`` Properties window.

![](Images/3.Geographic_visualisations_images/image9.png)

<br>

Add Measure: ``Charging Duration(hrs)``

![](Images/3.Geographic_visualisations_images/image10.png)

<br>

Add Dimension: ``CHARGEPOINTVENDOR``

![](Images/3.Geographic_visualisations_images/image11.png)

<br>

The resulting ``Chart`` should look as follows:.

![](Images/3.Geographic_visualisations_images/image11_1.png)

<br>


## Exercise 3.3 - Total consumption in kWH and Average charge cost by Vehicle Model

In this following graph we see the ``Total consumption in kWH`` as well as ``average cost`` per vehicle model. 

Lets build chart **Total Consumption in kWH and Average charge Cost(€) by Vehicle Model**

Click on the ``tile`` as indicated below, then select ``Designer`` (if the designer is not selected) to open up the ``Builder`` Properties window.

![](Images/3.Geographic_visualisations_images/image12.png)

<br>

Add Measure, Column Axis = ``Consumption in kWH`` and Line Axis = ``Average Cost by Vehicle Model``

![](Images/3.Geographic_visualisations_images/image13.png)

<br>

Go ahead and add Dimension = ``VEHICLEMODEL``

![](Images/3.Geographic_visualisations_images/image14.png)

<br>

Well done you have completed building the Chart.

![](Images/3.Geographic_visualisations_images/image15.png)

<br>

Now, your final ``Geo Story`` should looks as below:

![](Images/3.Geographic_visualisations_images/image16.png)

<br>



## Exercise 3.4 - Adding Linked Analysis to the GeoMap Story


On the GeoMap component, click on 3 dots and select ``Linked Analysis``.

![](Images/3.Geographic_visualisations_images/image17.png)

<br>

On the ``Linked Analysis`` properties window, select ``All Widgets on the Page`` and click on ``Filter on Data Point Selection`` check box and click Apply.

![](Images/3.Geographic_visualisations_images/image18.png)

<br>

**The Linked Analysis is enabled on the story!**

<br>

Click on any bubble on the GeoMap, you will see the all respective charts linked will change

<br>

**Congratulations!** With this you have successfully completed the Exercise!

<br>

This completes Exercise 3 - Geographic Visualizations
