# Introduction

SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC) is a new generation of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) that is built on the SAP HANA Cloud Platform which provides business intelligence, planning, and predictive capabilities for all users in one solution. In the boardroom, at the office, or in front of a customer, you can discover, analyze, plan, predict, and collabÂ­orate in one integrated experience designed expressly for the cloud. Access all data and embed analytics directly into business processes to turn instant insight into quick action.
