## Overview

Welcome to SAP TechEd 2021 session ANA160 - Give Data Purpose with SAP BTP and Cloud Analytics Solutions.

This session introduces attendees to the SAP data and analytics solutions in the cloud. You will get a hands-on experience of our flagship cloud solutions such as SAP Data Intelligence Cloud, SAP HANA Cloud, SAP Data Warehouse Cloud and SAP Analytics Cloud.


## Use Case

Employees are increasingly using electrical vehicles as their choice of company car. This creates challenges for companies to provide and manage charging infrastructure efficiently. Companies need to be able to provide sufficient power to run the charging stations, manage any error-prone charging stations and incentivize EV car users to charge at non-peak hours.

## Requirements

The requirements to follow the exercises in this repository are:
- SAP Data Intelligence tenant
- SAP SAC tenant
- SAP DWC tenant
Above requirements are already met, pre-created by SAP.

Instructions on how to start and use such trials are in [Exercise 0](exercises/ex0/).
